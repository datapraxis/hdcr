#Humanities Data Curation Record

A data curation record supports reuse of data and
reproducibility of claims by documenting data
source(s), data types and formats, data quality, as well as methods and tools used to subset, transform, augment, and
derive insight from data. With this record another researcher should be
able to:  

**(1)** understand how data are organized  
**(2)** access the methods and tools used to support analysis  
**(3)** be exposed to data cleaning and transformation processes  
**(4)** identify data source(s)

##Summary

When, where, and by whom the data were created

What the data topically describes (e.g. Black Death mortality rates)

Describe data features briefly (e.g. no. of records, mixture of text and tabular data)
